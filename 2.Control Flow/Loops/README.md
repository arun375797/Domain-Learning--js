# Loops

- `for.js` — index-based iteration and common patterns.
- `while.js` — loop until condition changes.
- `do-while.js` — execute at least once before checking.
- `for-of.js` — iterate over iterable values.
- `for-in.js` — loop over object keys (use with hasOwnProperty checks).

Experiment with breaking out of loops early and compare to array iteration helpers.
