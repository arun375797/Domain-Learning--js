# 2. Control Flow

Master decision-making and iteration patterns. Each subfolder contains examples
and practice prompts.

## Subfolders
- `Conditionals/`
- `Loops/`
- `Break and Continue/`
- `GuardClauses.js`

Work through conditionals first, then loops, and finish with guard clauses to
learn how to simplify nested branches.
