# Coverage & Continuous Integration

- Collect coverage with `jest --coverage` or `vitest --coverage`.
- Set thresholds in config files to prevent regressions.
- Configure GitHub Actions/GitLab CI to run tests on every push.
- Fail builds when tests or linting fail; surface reports in pull requests.
