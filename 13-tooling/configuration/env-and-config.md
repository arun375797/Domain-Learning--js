# Environment & Configuration

- `.env` files: store secrets, use dotenv in Node, import.meta.env in Vite.
- Distinguish `development`, `test`, `production` configs.
- Manage environment variables safely; never commit secrets.
- Document CLI scripts for building and serving in different environments.
