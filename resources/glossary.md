# Glossary

- Hoisting: JavaScript moves declarations to the top of scope during compilation.
- Closure: a function that remembers variables from its defining scope.
- Event loop: orchestrates call stack, callback queue, and microtask queue.
- Promise: an object representing the eventual completion or failure of async work.
- Idempotent: can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
