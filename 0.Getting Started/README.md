# Getting Started

Kick off your JavaScript refresh with environment setup and tooling basics.
Work through these files in order before jumping into the language topics.

## Files
- `Environment.md` — install Node.js, choose an editor, configure formatters.
- `Workflow.md` — run scripts in the browser and with Node, manage files.
- `Debugging.md` — practice using DevTools, breakpoints, and logging.
- `Cheatsheet.md` — quick reminders for commands and shortcuts.

> Tip: review this section briefly any time you switch machines to make sure
> your toolchain is aligned with the rest of the notes.
