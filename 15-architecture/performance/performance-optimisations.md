# Performance Optimisations

- Measure before optimising: use Lighthouse, Web Vitals, Node profiling.
- Debounce/throttle expensive events (scroll, resize, input).
- Memoise pure functions and component renders.
- Lazy-load routes/components, split bundles, cache API responses.
- Minimise reflows by batching DOM reads/writes.
