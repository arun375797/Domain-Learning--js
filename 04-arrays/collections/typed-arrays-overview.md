# Typed Arrays Overview

- `Uint8Array`, `Float32Array`, and friends allow working with binary data.
- Use `ArrayBuffer` to allocate raw memory, then create typed views.
- Common in Web APIs like WebGL, WebAudio, and file processing.
- Practice: read a file into a typed array and inspect byte lengths.
