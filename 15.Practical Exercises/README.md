# Practical Exercises

Use these folders to drill core JavaScript skills. Each topic takes the same
approach:

- Every individual challenge lives inside `exercises/<name>.js`.
- The topic-level `practice.js` simply re-exports those exercises so you can
  import everything from a single module if needed.
- The accompanying `README.md` outlines each prompt in plain language.

## Folder Map
- `01.Warmups` - quick syntax reps, conversions, counters.
- `02.Control Flow` - branching, loops, guard clauses, classic FizzBuzz variants.
- `03.Functions` - closures, currying, memoisation, call/apply/bind drills.
- `04.Arrays` - two-sum variations, dedupe, rotation, chunking, frequency maps.
- `05.Objects` - deep copies, value lookups, removing odd-valued keys, method borrowing.
- `06.Strings` - palindrome, anagram, word swapping, formatting tasks.
- `07.DOM` - DOM/BOM behaviours: toggles, delegation, debouncing, countdown timers.
- `08.Asynchronous` - timers, retries, concurrency limits, memoised fetches.

Add solution files alongside the stubs or keep answers in a separate `solutions`
folder if you prefer. Revisit the challenges periodically to refresh muscle
memory and track progress in `14.Resources/progress-log.md`.
