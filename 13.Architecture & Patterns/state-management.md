# State Management

- Local component state vs global app state; pick the smallest scope required.
- Patterns: lifting state up, context API, Redux-style reducers, Zustand/Pinia stores.
- Normalise data to avoid duplication; derive computed values when needed.
- Sync state with URL/search params for shareable links.
