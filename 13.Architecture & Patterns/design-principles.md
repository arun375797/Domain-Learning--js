# Design Principles

- SOLID: single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion.
- DRY vs WET: avoid duplication but prioritize clarity.
- YAGNI: build only what you need; avoid premature abstractions.
- Separation of concerns: split data, presentation, logic.
