# Event Loop

- `microtasks-vs-macrotasks.js` — explore execution order of promises vs timers.
- `call-stack.js` — log stack frames to show synchronous execution.
- `diagram.md` — draw your own event loop diagram with notes.

Run each script and predict the log order before executing to test your understanding.
