# Async/Await

- `async-basics.js` — declare async functions and await promises.
- `error-handling.js` — try/catch patterns, sequential vs parallel awaits.
- `parallel-execution.js` — run tasks concurrently with `Promise.all`.

Compare these examples with the promise-based implementations to see trade-offs.
