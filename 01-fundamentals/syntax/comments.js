/**
 * Comments and Code Style
 * 
 * WHAT TO LEARN:
 * 
 * 1. SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS
 *    - Use // for single line
 *    - Everything after // is ignored
 *    - Can appear at end of code line
 *    - // This is a comment
 *    - let x = 5; // Initialize x
 * 
 * 2. MULTI-LINE COMMENTS
 *    - Use /* ... */ for multiple lines
 *    - Can span many lines
 *    - /*
 *      This is
 *      a multi-line
 *      comment
 *     */
 * 
 * 3. DOCUMENTATION COMMENTS (JSDOC)
 *    - Use /** ... */ for documentation
 *    - Special format for tools
 *    - Describes functions, parameters, return values
 *    - IDE can show tooltips from JSDoc
 *    - /**
 *      * Adds two numbers
 *      * @param {number} a - First number
 *      * @param {number} b - Second number
 *      * @returns {number} Sum
 *      */
 * 
 * 4. WHEN TO COMMENT
 *    - Explain WHY, not WHAT
 *    - Document complex algorithms
 *    - Note workarounds or hacks
 *    - Explain business logic
 *    - Warning about edge cases
 * 
 * 5. WHEN NOT TO COMMENT
 *    - Obvious code: let x = 5; // Set x to 5
 *    - Code that can be self-explanatory
 *    - Instead: use good variable/function names
 *    - Don't comment out code (use version control)
 * 
 * 6. CODE READABILITY
 *    - Use meaningful variable names
 *    - Keep functions short
 *    - One function = one responsibility
 *    - Consistent indentation
 *    - Blank lines to group related code
 * 
 * 7. LINE LENGTH
 *    - Keep under 80-100 characters
 *    - Easier to read
 *    - Multiple editors side by side
 *    - Break long lines appropriately
 * 
 * 8. INDENTATION
 *    - Use 2 or 4 spaces consistently
 *    - Or tabs (choose one)
 *    - Indent code blocks
 *    - Align related code
 * 
 * 9. WHITESPACE
 *    - Space after keywords: if (condition)
 *    - Space around operators: x + y
 *    - Blank line between functions
 *    - Group related statements
 * 
 * 10. NAMING CONVENTIONS
 *     - camelCase for variables and functions
 *     - PascalCase for classes
 *     - UPPER_CASE for constants
 *     - Descriptive names
 *     - Avoid abbreviations
 * 
 * 11. COMMENTED OUT CODE
 *     - Don't leave commented code
 *     - Use version control instead
 *     - Can confuse others
 *     - Makes codebase messy
 * 
 * 12. TODO COMMENTS
 *     - Mark incomplete work
 *     - // TODO: Implement error handling
 *     - // FIXME: This has a bug
 *     - // HACK: Temporary workaround
 *     - Tools can find these
 */

// Use // for single-line comments and /* ... */ for multi-line explanations
// Keep lines under ~100 characters and group related code with blank lines
// Practice rewriting a dense snippet to improve readability
