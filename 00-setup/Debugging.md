# Debugging Essentials

- In Chrome/Edge, open DevTools with `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`; use the `Sources`
  panel to set breakpoints and step through code.
- Practice with `debugger;` statements to pause execution at key lines.
- Inspect network requests via the `Network` tab and filter by `Fetch/XHR`.
- Use `console.table`, `console.time`, and `console.trace` for richer logs.
- Capture screenshots of tricky bugs and store them with notes for future reference.
